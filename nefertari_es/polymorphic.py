"""
Module that defines all the objects required to handle polymorphic
collection read requests.

Im particular:
    * PolymorphicACL: Dynamic factory class that generates ACL considering
        ACLs of all the collections requested.
    * PolymorphicView: View that handles polymorphic collection read
        requests.

This module is enabled by including it with Pyramid Configurator and
specifying `elasticsearch.enable_polymorphic_query = true` setting in
your .ini file.

After inclusion, PolymorphicView view will be registered to handle GET
requests. To access polymorphic API endpoint, compose URL with names
used to access collection GET API endpoints.

E.g. If API had collection endpoints '/users' and '/stories', polymorphic
endpoint would be available at '/users,stories' and '/stories,users'.

Polymorphic endpoints support all the read functionality regular ES
endpoint supports: query, search, filter, sort, etc.
